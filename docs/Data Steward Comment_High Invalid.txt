This indicates that countyCode is not being consistently populated in the source data. Requesting clarification from the source system on whether countyCode is expected to be provided for all providers. If the field is optional for certain provider types, please provide the business rules so the DQ rule can be refined accordingly. Otherwise, an upstream correction is needed to ensure countyCode is populated with a valid 5‑digit numeric code.'

Current rule enforces vbpAdjustment as mandatory for all non‑blank indicators, causing potential false positives. Rule should be refined to (1) disallow vbpAdjustment when the indicator is blank, and (2) validate vbpAdjustment as numeric and ≥ 0 only when it is populated.'

Current run shows 13,062 records with a value of 0 and 210 records with NULL, totaling 13,272 invalid entries. This indicates that bedSize is not being consistently populated in the source system. Requesting clarification on whether bedSize is expected for all providers and, if so, an upstream correction to ensure valid positive bed counts are supplied. If certain provider types legitimately have no inpatient beds, business rules are needed to refine the DQ rule accordingly.'

Current run shows 7,116 invalid records with values 0.0000, 0.0010, and 0.1000, indicating incorrect or missing COLA population in the source system. Requesting clarification from the source on how COLA is derived and whether these values reflect defaulting, mapping issues, or legacy data. Upstream correction or rule‑specific business guidance is required.'
